Take an inside look into a CS student's curriculum. ðŸ’»

This repository is a real-life example of the projects I'm currently doing in getting my CS degree.

I'm currently in CISP 1010 (Intro to Computer Science), so these classes are very basic, but with time they will become increasingly difficult,
and I'm happy to share my progress into learning C++ and Computer science as a whole!

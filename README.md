Take an inside look into a CS student's curriculum. ðŸ’»

This repository is a real-life example of the projects I'm currently doing while getting my CS degree.

I'm currently in CISP 1010 (Intro to Computer Science), so these classes are very basic, but with time they will become increasingly difficult,
and I'm happy to share my progress into learning C++ and Computer science as a whole!

The project are not in order of difficulty, and are just posted to inform you of projects you could encounter during a CS class. (Amongst other things).

Fall 18'

Just began Computer Science 2 and have been venturing into vectors and classes throughout the beginning weeks. We will be looking into Inheritance, Composition, and many other class-related techniques over the next few weeks. Will update when we get there with projects that are related.
